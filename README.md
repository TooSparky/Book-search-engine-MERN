# Book-Search-Engine-MERN

## Description

The application allows a non-logged-in user to search for books through a google API. Once signed up and logged in, the user can then save searched books to a list. The goal of this project was not to focus on this functionality, but to change from REST to MERN.

## Installation

To install the required npm packages, simply type 'npm install'.

## Usage

The project is easy to use, simply log in or sign up if it is your first time, then search for a book you would like to read, and save it to your new list!
